# EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) on The Iris Dataset

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves utilizing visual techniques to analyze data, providing detailed statistical summaries and enabling the identification and handling of duplicate values and outliers. Additionally, EDA allows for the detection of trends and patterns within the dataset.

## Iris Dataset

### The Iris Dataset is often regarded as the introductory benchmark in the field of data science. It comprises five columns, namely Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal Width, and Species Type. This dataset originates from the measurements of various iris flowers conducted by researchers and recorded digitally.
### To access the Iris.csv file, it can be downloaded from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) repository. Utilizing the Pandas library, we will load this CSV file and convert it into a dataframe. The read_csv() method within Pandas is employed for reading CSV files.
